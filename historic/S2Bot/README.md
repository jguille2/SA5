#Snap! and S2Bot

S2Bot from [Picaxe](http://www.picaxe.com/) allows us to connect multiple devices to our projects. We can use PicoBoard, Sphero, Ollie, BB8, SBrick i LEGO WeDo, WeDo 2.0, NXT i EV3.


##Working with S2Bot

  - Download [S2Bot Helper App](http://www.picaxe.com/Teaching/Other-Software/Scratch-Helper-Apps).
  - Then, connect the your device.

##Opening Snap!

With the Scratch templates includes in S2Bot, you can see the way to connect Snap.

We provide the blocks to work with WeDo. It's a first version (but tested and running ok). You can report any problems or suggestions using [github](https://github.com/jguille2/SA5/issues/new). If needed, we can also provide xml files for other devices (though perhaps we can not test).

###Working wit Lego WeDo

  - Use [Snap! online](http://snap.berkeley.edu/run) or an offline version. We can also use [Snap4Arduino](http://s4a.cat/snap/) or other snap based projects.
  - Import [this file with WeDo blocs](http://ateneu.xtec.cat/wikiform/wikiexport/_media/materials/crea3/hw/ss2bot/blocks_snap_wedo.xml) with the WeDo blocks.
  - You can also load [this project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jguille2&ProjectName=snapBlocks_WeDo) from the cloud.
  - Got to the **Sensing category** and you'll find the generic WeDo blocks.

Any feedback will be apreciated. You can use [github issues](https://github.com/jguille2/SA5/issues).
