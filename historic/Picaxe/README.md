#Snap! and Picaxe

##Working with S2P

  - We use S2P software from [Picaxe](http://www.picaxe.com/) to connect the board.
  - [Cable drivers](http://www.picaxe.com/Software/Drivers) are needed.
  - Download [S2P Helper App](http://www.picaxe.com/Software/Third-Party/Scratch/).
  - It's needed 0.13 version or later (0.11 and 0.12 are not running with non Scratch software)
  - Then, connect the board choosing your *Picaxe hardware* and the *COM port*. 'Mode 1 light' must be green.

##Opening Snap!

  - Use [Snap! online](http://snap.berkeley.edu/run) or an offline version. We can also use [Snap4Arduino](http://s4a.cat/snap/) or other snap based projects.
  - Import [this file with Picaxe blocs](http://ateneu.xtec.cat/wikiform/serveis/media/snapBlocks_picaxe.xml) or [this project](http://ateneu.xtec.cat/wikiform/serveis/media/snapProject_picaxe.xml) with blocks and a mapping example of sensors.
  - You can load this projects from the cloud: [blocks](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jguille2&ProjectName=snapBlocks_picaxe) or [project](http://snap.berkeley.edu/snapsource/snap.html#present:Username=jguille2&ProjectName=snapProject_picaxe)
  - Got to the **Sensing category** and you'll find the generic picaxe blocks.

This is a first version! We want to test it with different hardware, and make customs snap projects for different boards, hardwares, educational levels...

Any feedback will be apreciated. You can use github issues or the Picaxe forum
